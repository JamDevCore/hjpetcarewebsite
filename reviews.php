    <p id="testSlider">Helen was a wonderful cat sitter for us she made us feel completely confident at leaving Oscar. She was so professional and caring our cat loed her. We will definitely ask her back. Loved the updates and photos she sent us whilst we were away. I have no hesitation in recommending Helen. Lovely kind lady and absolutely fabulous cat sitter. Our home was also immaculate on our return.</p>

    <p id="testSlider">Helen is a fabulous cat/ house sitter. This is the second time she has taken care of our cat Oscar. She is amazing with him. Helen really cares for animals. It is so lovely to receive photographs of our precious puss cat whilst we are away, it means so much. A truly amazing lovely lady. An immaculate home on our return also. We highly recommend Helen. You will not be disappointed.</p>

    	<h5>August 2017</h5>
    <p id="testSlider">Helen & Andy were great house sitters. Very conscientious and super attentive to Gemma, our aged dog with diabetes and two young cats. Not easy to administer injections twice a day to a dog, but Helen mastered the art. They sent us daily updates with pictures which was reassuring. We came back to happy pets, a clean house, blue swimming pool and a supper.</p>

      <h5>September 2017</h5>
    <p id="testSlider">Helen was amazing, it's the first time I have left my dogs with anyone as I am a breeder so I have many dogs. Helen took into account every personality in all the dogs, she made sure all their needs were met, she would send me daily updates including photos. I will be using Helen to look after the dogs when I go on holiday or even for a day out.</p>

      <h5>August 2017</h5>
    <p id="testSlider">At very short notice Helen was available to look after our house and cat Minoushka for four days. It's a bit of a trek getting to Cordes, but Helen kept in contact with us during her journey, flight and train, and arrived on time. While we were away she kept us updated about Minoushka, including photos, and the delivery of fuel. We arrived home to a very welcome dinner that Helen had left for us and a happy Minoushka</p>
